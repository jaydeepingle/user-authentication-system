Remove the following text, adding in any further comments you would
like the grader to read.  Among other things, this could include the
following:

  + If your project is incomplete, describe its status, what works
    and what does not.

  + Anything particularly novel or interesting in your implementation.

  + The overall algorithm, design or procedure used if it is
    non-trivial.

You should not need to comment the code here; it should be commented
in source files.  If your code needs a lot of comments, then it may
indicate that you need to rethink your code.
